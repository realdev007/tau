### Step 1: Create a New Repository

1. **On GitHub:**
   - Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
   - Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
   - Fill in the repository name, description, and choose whether it should be public or private.
   - Click "Create repository."

2. **Locally:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create the repository.
   - Run the following command to create a new directory for your repository:
     ```bash
     mkdir my-repo
     cd my-repo
     ```

### Step 2: Initialize Git

Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
```bash
git init
```

### Step 3: Create the Folder Structure

You can create the desired folder structure using the `mkdir` command. For example, if you want to create the following structure:

```
my-repo/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── styles/
│   └── utils/
├── tests/
├── docs/
└── README.md
```

You can run the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components src/styles src/utils tests docs
touch README.md
```

### Step 4: Add Files and Commit

You can add files to your repository and make your first commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit with folder structure"
```

### Step 5: Link to GitHub (Optional)

If you want to push your local repository to GitHub, you need to link it:

1. Copy the repository URL from GitHub.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git remote add origin <repository-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Summary

You have now created a new repository with a specified folder structure both locally and on GitHub. You can customize the folder names and structure according to your project's needs. If you have a specific folder structure in mind, please let me know, and I can provide tailored commands!
